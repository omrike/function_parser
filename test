# In TF 2.x, if the `tf.nn.softmax` is used as an activation function in Keras
# layers, it gets serialized as 'softmax_v2' instead of 'softmax' as the
# internal method name is returned in serialization. This results in errors in
# model exporting and loading as Keras can't find any activation function with
# the name of `softmax_v2`.
# This dict maps the activation function name from its v2 version to its
# canonical name.
